# The shapes rewritten here are exactly the shapes the doc_surface gate
# parses (`the_readmes_agree_on_one_version`): a `dynamic-config…` or
# `version` assignment carrying a bare x.y.z string. Prose mentions of a
# version are deliberately left alone — the old objection to automating
# this was that a regex loose enough to catch prose catches too much, and
# the answer is to not catch prose. The book never carries the number at
# all; its snippets say `<version>`.
